## Using this Repository

### <ins>Setting up the Environment</ins>
To set up the environment to run the code, make sure to have conda installed, then run

    conda env create -f environment.yml

Then, activate the environment

    conda activate rewrite

**Important!**: The environment is setup to run with a CUDA version compatible with RTX6000 GPUs. You may need to update the environment based on your own GPUs.

### <ins>Compute Requirements</ins>

We recommend using a single RTX6000 GPU (this is what we used for our experiments) or another NVIDIA GPU with >24GB VRAM to enable large-scale rewriting (large batch size). Our method can also run on smaller models <24GB VRAM, but you should set the batch size to be lower.

### <ins>Detoxification with MaRCo</ins>

See `rewrite/README.md` for details on how to run the detoxification pipeline,

### <ins>Expert Models</ins>

The expert and anti-expert models are available on huggingface here:
* [Expert](https://huggingface.co/hallisky/bart-base-nontoxic-expert): BART-base further finetuned on the ***non-toxic*** portion of the Jigsaw Corpus with the same pretraining masked denoising objective
* [Anti-Expert](https://huggingface.co/hallisky/bart-base-toxic-antiexpert): BART-base further finetuned on the ***toxic*** portion of the Jigsaw Corpus with the same pretraining masked denoising objective

You can download then load them or use these directly from the huggingface transfomers library, ie, 

    # Load model directly
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("hallisky/bart-base-nontoxic-expert")
    model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("hallisky/bart-base-nontoxic-expert")

If you want to train your own expert/anti-expert models on BART with custom hyperparameter/dataset, please see the `training` folder of this repository.

### <ins>Datasets</ins>

See `datasets/README.md` for access to the datasets and a description. 

### <ins>Evaluation</ins>

See `evaluation/README.md` for the evaluation pipeline on detoxifications.

        abstract = "Text detoxification has the potential to mitigate the harms of toxicity by rephrasing text to remove offensive meaning, but subtle toxicity remains challenging to tackle. We introduce MaRCo, a detoxification algorithm that combines controllable generation and text rewriting methods using a Product of Experts with autoencoder language models (LMs). MaRCo uses likelihoods under a non-toxic LM (expert) and a toxic LM (anti-expert) to find candidate words to mask and potentially replace. We evaluate our method on several subtle toxicity and microaggressions datasets, and show that it not only outperforms baselines on automatic metrics, but MaRCo{'}s rewrites are preferred 2.1 times more in human evaluation. Its applicability to instances of subtle toxicity is especially promising, demonstrating a path forward for addressing increasingly elusive online hate.",
